# Supabase Environments (No-Pro Workflow)

## Environments
- `local`: daily development with Supabase CLI (`supabase start`).
- `sunnad-dev`: hosted free project for integration testing.
- `sunnad-prod`: hosted free project for production data.

## Branching policy
- Do not rely on paid hosted preview branches for routine workflow.
- Validate schema locally first, then promote to dev, then prod.

## Schema promotion flow
1. Create migration SQL in `supabase/migrations/`.
2. Verify from scratch locally:
   - `supabase db reset`
3. Push to dev project and smoke test.
4. Push the same migration set to prod.

## Data safety rules
- Never commit secrets or service keys.
- Keep RLS as the authorization layer.
- All schema changes are migration-driven.
